        <h1>Community Standards</h1>
        <p>Our Community Standards apply to everyone, all around the world, and to all types of content.</p>
        <p>Each section of our Community Standards starts with a “Policy Rationale” that sets out the aims of the policy
            followed by specific policy lines that Content that's not allowed; and
            Content that requires additional information or context to enforce on, content that is allowed with a
            warning screen or content that is allowed but can only be viewed by adults aged 18 and older.
        </p>
        <p>Content that's not allowed and Content that requires additional information or context to enforce on,</p>
        <p>content that is allowed with a warning screen or content that is allowed but can only be viewed by adults
            aged 18 and older.</p>

        <h2>Violence and Incitement</h2>
        <h3>Policy Rationale</h3>
        <p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on SFERA. While we understand that
            people commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways,
            we remove language that incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts and
            work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to
            public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in order to distinguish casual statements
            from content that constitutes a credible threat to public or personal safety. In determining whether a
            threat is credible, we may also consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the
            risks to their physical safety.</p>
        <p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and other violent actors
            (e.g. "Terrorists deserve to be killed"), and we deem those non-credible, absent specific evidence to the
            contrary.</p>
        <h4>Do not post:</h4>

        <p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce:</p>
        <h4>Do not post:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Violent threats against law enforcement officers.</li>
            <li>Violent threats against people accused of a crime. We remove this content when we have reason to believe
                that the content is intended to cause physical harm.</li>
            <li>Coded statements where the method of violence or harm is not clearly articulated, but the threat is
                veiled or implicit. Meta looks at the below signals to determine whether there is a threat of harm in
                the content.</li>
            <li>Shared in a retaliatory context (e.g., expressions of desire to do something harmful to others in
                response to a grievance or threat that may be real, perceived or anticipated)</li>
            <li>References to historical or fictional incidents of violence (e.g., content that threatens others by
                referring to known historical incidents of violence that have been executed throughout history or in
                fictional settings)</li>
            <li>Acts as a threatening call-to-action (e.g. content inviting or encouraging others to carry out harmful
                acts or to join in carrying out the harmful acts)</li>
            <li>Indicates knowledge of or shares sensitive information that could expose others to harm (e.g. content
                that either makes note of or implies awareness of personal information that might make a threat of
                physical violence more credible. This includes implying knowledge of a person's residential address,
                their place of employment or education, daily commute routes or current location)</li>
            <li>Local context or subject matter expertise confirms that the statement in question could be threatening
                and/or could lead to imminent violence or physical harm.</li>
            <li>The subject of the threat reports the content to us.</li>
            <li>Threats against election officials</li>
            <li>Implicit statements of intent or advocacy, calls to action, or aspirational or conditional statements to
                bring armaments to locations, including but not limited to places of worship, educational facilities,
                polling places, or locations used to count votes or administer an election (or encouraging others to do
                the same). We may also restrict calls to bring armaments to certain locations where there are
                temporarily signals of a heightened risk of violence or offline harm. This may be the case, for example,
                when there is a known protest and counter-protest planned or violence broke out at a protest in the same
                city within the last 7 days </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dangerous Individuals and Organizations</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do not allow organizations or individuals that
            proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on SFERA. We assess these entities
            based on their behavior both online and offline, most significantly, their ties to violence. Under this
            policy, we designate individuals, organizations, and networks of people. These designations are divided into
            three tiers that indicate the level of content enforcement, with Tier 1 resulting in the most extensive
            enforcement because we believe these entities have the most direct ties to offline harm.</p>
        <p><b>Tier 1</b> focuses on entities that engage in serious offline harms - including organizing or advocating
            for violence against civilians, repeatedly dehumanizing or advocating for harm against people based on
            protected characteristics, or engaging in systematic criminal operations. Tier 1 entities include terrorist,
            hate, and criminal organizations. We remove praise, substantive support, and representation of Tier 1
            entities as well as their leaders, founders, or prominent members. Tier 1 includes hate organizations;
            criminal organizations, including those designated by the United States government as Specially Designated
            Narcotics Trafficking Kingpins (SDNTKs); and terrorist organizations, including entities and individuals
            designated by the United States government as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) or Specially Designated
            Global Terrorists (SDGTs). We remove praise, substantive support, and representation of Tier 1 entities as
            well as their leaders, founders, or prominent members.</p>
        <p>In addition, we do not allow content that praises, substantively supports, or represents events that SFERA
            designates as violating violent events - including terrorist attacks, hate events, multiple-victim violence
            or attempted multiple-victim violence, multiple murders, or hate crimes. Nor do we allow praise, substantive
            support, or representation of the perpetrator(s) of such attacks. We also remove content that praises,
            substantively supports or represents ideologies that promote hate, such as nazism and white supremacy.</p>
        <p><b>Tier 2</b> focuses on entities that engage in violence against state or military actors but do not
            generally target civilians -- what we call “Violent Non-State Actors.” We remove all substantive support and
            representation of these entities, their leaders, and their prominent members. We remove any praise of these
            groups’ violent activities.</p>
        <p><b>Tier 3</b> focuses on entities that may repeatedly engage in violations of our Hate Speech or Dangerous
            Organizations policies on-or-off the platform or demonstrate strong intent to engage in offline violence in
            the near future, but have not necessarily engaged in violence to date or advocated for violence against
            others based on their protected characteristics. This includes Militarized Social Movements,
            Violence-Inducing Conspiracy Networks, and individuals and groups banned for promoting hatred. Tier 3
            entities may not have a presence or coordinate on our platforms.</p>
        <p>We recognize that users may share content that includes references to designated dangerous organizations and
            individuals to report on, condemn, or neutrally discuss them or their activities. Our policies are designed
            to allow room for these types of discussions while simultaneously limiting risks of potential offline harm.
            We thus require people to clearly indicate their intent when creating or sharing such content. If a user's
            intention is ambiguous or unclear, we default to removing content.</p>
        <p>In line with international human rights law, our policies allow discussions about the human rights of
            designated individuals or members of designated dangerous entities, unless the content includes other
            praise, substantive support, or representation of designated entities or other policy violations, such as
            incitement to violence.</p>
        <h4>We Remove:</h4>
        <p>We remove Praise, Substantive Support, and Representation of various Dangerous Organizations. These concepts
            apply to the organizations themselves, their activities, and their members. These concepts do not proscribe
            peaceful advocacy for particular political outcomes. </p>

            </li>

                    <li>E.g., “Hitler did nothing wrong.”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Aligning oneself ideologically with a designated entity or event.

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

            by Tier 2 entities.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>E.g., “Donate to the KKK!”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Any act which provides material aid to a designated entity or event;
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g., “If you want to send care packages to the Sinaloa Cartel, use this address:”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Putting out a call to action on behalf of a designated entity or event;
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g., “Contact the Atomwaffen Division - (XXX) XXX-XXXX”</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We remove Substantive Support of Tier 1 and Tier 2 entities and designated events.</p>
        <p><b>Representation,</b> defined as any of the below:</p>

            <li>Stating that you are a member of a designated entity, or are a designated entity;

            <li>While our designations of organizations and individuals focus on behavior, we also recognize that
                there are certain ideologies and beliefs that are inherently tied to violence and attempts to organize
                people around calls for violence or exclusion of others based on their protected characteristics. In
                these cases, we designate the ideology itself and remove content that supports this ideology from our
                platform. These ideologies include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Nazism</li>
                    <li>White Supremacy</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>We remove explicit Praise, Substantive Support, and Representation of these ideologies, and remove
                individuals and organizations that ascribe to one or more of these hateful ideologies.</li>

        <h2><u>SAFETY</u></h2>
        <h3>Suicide and Self Injury</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>We care deeply about the safety of the people who use our apps.</p>
        <p>While we do not allow people to intentionally or unintentionally celebrate or promote suicide or self-injury,
            we do allow people to discuss these topics because we want SFERA to be a space where people can share their
            experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and seek support from one another. </p>
        <p>We define self-injury as the intentional and direct injuring of the body, including self-mutilation and
            eating disorders. We remove any content that encourages suicide or self-injury, including fictional content
            such as memes or illustrations and any self-injury content which is graphic, regardless of context. We also
            remove content that identifies and negatively targets victims or survivors of suicide or self-injury
            seriously, humorously or rhetorically, as well as real time depictions of suicide or self-injury. Content
            about recovery of suicide or self-harm that is allowed, but may contain imagery that could be upsetting,
            such as a healed scar, is placed behind a sensitivity screen. </p>
        <p>When people post or search for suicide or self-injury- related content, we will direct them to local
            organizations that can provide support and if our Community Operations team is concerned about immediate
            harm we will contact local emergency services to get them help.</p>
        <h4>Do not post:</h4>

            <li>Eating disorders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Content that depicts graphic self-injury imagery</p>
        <p>It is against our policies to post content depicting a person who engaged in a suicide attempt or death by
            suicide</p>
        <p>Content that focuses on depiction of ribs, collar bones, thigh gaps, hips, concave stomach, or protruding
            spine or scapula when shared together with terms associated with eating disorders</p>
        <p>Content that contains instructions for drastic and unhealthy weight loss when shared together with terms
            associated with eating disorders.</p>

            known or implied to have experienced suicide or self-injury</p>

        <h3>Child Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Nudity</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>We do not allow content or activity that sexually exploits or endangers children. We know that sometimes
            people share nude images of their own children with good intentions; however, we generally remove these
            images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people
            reusing or misappropriating the images. </p>

        <h3>Adult Sexual Exploitation</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>We recognize the importance of SFERA as a place to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and
            exploitation. In an effort to create space for this conversation and promote a safe environment, we allow
            victims to share their experiences, but remove content that depicts, threatens or promotes sexual violence,
            sexual assault, or sexual exploitation. We also remove content that displays, advocates for or coordinates
            sexual acts with non-consenting parties to avoid facilitating non-consensual sexual acts. </p>
        <p>To protect victims and survivors, we remove images that depict incidents of sexual violence and intimate
            images shared without the consent of the person(s) pictured.</p>
        <h4>Do not post:</h4>
        <p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching, necrophilia, or forced
            stripping, including:</p>

        <p>Content mocking the concept of non-consensual sexual touching</p>
        <p><b>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce: </b>
        </p>
        <p>We may restrict visibility to people over the age of 18 and include a warning label on certain fictional
            videos (e.g., digital and hand-drawn imagery, film and TV show scenes, comic books, music videos) that
            depict non-consensual sexual touching.</p>
        <p>In addition to our at-scale policy of removing content that threatens or advocates rape or other
            non-consensual sexual touching, we may also disable the posting account.</p>
        <h3>Bullying and Harassment</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms from making threats and
            releasing personally identifiable information to sending threatening messages and making unwanted malicious
            contact. We do not tolerate this kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected
            on SFERA.</p>
        <p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to allow discussion, which
            often includes critical commentary of people who are featured in the news or who have a large public
            audience. For public figures, we remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public
            figure is directly tagged in the post or comment.</p>
        <p>For private individuals, our protection goes further: We remove content that's meant to degrade or shame,
            including, for example, claims about someone's sexual personal activity. We recognize that bullying and
            harassment can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our policies provide heightened
            protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18.</p>
        <p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to post and share if it is clear that something was shared in
            order to condemn or draw attention to bullying and harassment. In certain instances, we require
            self-reporting because it helps us understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed.</p>

        <h3>Human Exploitation</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>In an effort to disrupt and prevent harm, we remove content that facilitates or coordinates the exploitation
            of humans, including human trafficking. We define human trafficking as the business of depriving someone of
            liberty for profit. It is the exploitation of humans in order to force them to engagein commercial sex,
            labor or other activities against their will. It relies on deception, force and coercion, and degrades
            humans by depriving them of their freedom while economically or materially benefiting others.</p>
        <p>Human trafficking is multi-faceted and global; it can affect anyone regardless of age, socioeconomic
            background, ethnicity, gender or location. It takes many forms, and any given trafficking situation can
            involve various stages of development. By the coercive nature of this abuse, victims cannot consent.</p>
        <p>While we need to be careful not to conflate human trafficking and smuggling, they can be related and exhibit
            overlap. The United Nations defines human smuggling as the procurement or facilitation of illegal entry into
            a state across international borders. Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the
            exploitation of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in pursuit of
            a better life. Human smuggling is a crime against a state, relying on movement, and human trafficking is a
            crime against a person, relying on exploitation.</p>
        <h4>Do not post:</h4>
        <p>Content or exhibited behavior that may lead to human exploitation, which includes any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sex trafficking, covering minors and adults.</li>
            <li>Sales of children or illegal adoption.</li>
            <li>Orphanage trafficking and orphanage volun-tourism.</li>
            <li>Forced marriages.</li>

            <li>Recruitment of child soldiers.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Recruitment of potential victims through force, fraud, coercion, enticement, deception, blackmail or
                other non-consensual acts.</li>
            <li>Facilitation of human exploitation by coordinating, transporting, transferring, harboring or brokering
                of victims prior or during the exploitation. </li>
            <li>Exploitation of humans by promoting, depicting or advocating for it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Privacy Violations</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>Privacy and the protection of personal information are fundamentally important values for SFERA. We work hard
            to safeguard your personal identity and information and we do not allow people to post personal or
            confidential information about yourself or of others.</p>
        <p>We remove content that shares, offers or solicits personally identifiable information or other private
            information that could lead to physical or financial harm, including financial, residential, and medical
            information, as well as private information obtained from illegal sources. We also recognize that private
            information may become publicly available through news coverage, court filings, press releases, or other
            sources. When that happens, we may allow the information to be posted.</p>
        <p>We also provide people ways to report imagery that they believe to be in violation of their privacy rights.

        </p>
        <h2>OBJECTIONABLE CONTENT</h2>
        <h3>Hate Speech</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>We believe that people use their voice and connect more freely when they don’t feel attacked on the basis of
            who they are. That is why we don’t allow hate speech on SFERA. It creates an environment of intimidation and
            exclusion, and in some cases may promote offline violence.</p>
        <p>We define hate speech as a direct attack against people — rather than concepts or institutions— on the basis
            of what we call protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious
            affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and serious disease. We define attacks as
            violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt,
            disgust or dismissal, cursing and calls for exclusion or segregation. We also prohibit the use of harmful
            stereotypes, which we define as dehumanizing comparisons that have historically been used to attack,
            intimidate, or exclude specific groups, and that are often linked with offline violence. We consider age a
            protected characteristic when referenced along with another protected characteristic. We also protect
            refugees, migrants, immigrants and asylum seekers from the most severe attacks, though we do allow
            commentary and criticism of immigration policies. Similarly, we provide some protections for characteristics
            like occupation, when they’re referenced along with a protected characteristic. Sometimes, based on local
            nuance, we consider certain words or phrases as frequently used proxies for PC groups. </p>
        <p>We recognize that people sometimes share content that includes someone else’s hate speech to condemn it or
            raise awareness. In other cases, speech that might otherwise violate our standards can be used
            self-referentially or in an empowering way. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of
            speech, but we require people to clearly indicate their intent. If the intention is unclear, we may remove
            content.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Do not post:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Content explicitly providing or offering to provide products or services that aim to change people’s

                of signs to determine whether there is a threat of harm in the content. These include but are not
                limited to: content that could incite imminent violence or intimidation; whether there is a period of
                heightened tension such as an election or ongoing conflict; and whether there is a recent history of
                violence against the targeted protected group. In some cases, we may also consider whether the speaker

        <p>In certain cases, we will allow content that may otherwise violate the Community Standards when it is
            determined that the content is satirical. Content will only be allowed if the violating elements of the

        </p>
        <h3>Violent and Graphic Content</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation of others because it may
            create an environment that discourages participation. We allow graphic content (with some limitations) to
            help people raise awareness about these issues.</p>
        <p>We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human rights abuses or acts of
            terrorism. We also know that people have different sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content.

        <h3>Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>We restrict the display of nudity or sexual activity because some people in our community may be sensitive to
            this type of content. Additionally, we default to removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of
            non-consensual or underage content. Restrictions on the display of sexual activity also apply to digitally
            created content unless it is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. </p>

        <h3>Sexual Solicitation</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Standards (Adult Sexual Exploitation), people use SFERA to discuss and
            draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We recognize the importance of and allow for this
            discussion.We also allow for the discussion of sex worker rights advocacy and sex work regulation. We draw
            the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates sexual encounters or commercial
            sexual services between adults. We do this to avoid facilitating transactions that may involve trafficking,
            coercion and non-consensual sexual acts. </p>
        <p>We also restrict sexually-explicit language that may lead to sexual solicitation because some audiences
            within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content, and it may impede the ability for
            people to connect with their friends and the broader community.</p>
        <h4>Do not post:</h4>
        <p>Content that offers or asks for adult commercial services, such as requesting, offering or asking for rates
            for escort service and paid sexual fetish or domination services. (Content that recruits or offers other
            people for third-party commercial sex work is separately considered under the (Human Exploitation policy)

        <p>Content that is implicitly or indirectly offering or asking for sexual solicitation and meets both of the
            following criteria. If both criteria are not met, it is not deemed to be violating. For example, if content
            is a hand-drawn image depicting sexual activity but does not ask or offer sexual solicitation, it is not
            violating:</p>

        <h2>INTEGRITY AND AUTHENTICITY</h2>
        <h3>Account Integrity and Authentic Identity</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>Authenticity is the cornerstone of our community. We believe that authenticity helps create a community where
            people are accountable to each other, and to SFERA, in meaningful ways. We want to allow for the range of
            diverse ways that identity is expressed across our global community, while also preventing impersonation and
            identity misrepresentation. That is why we require people to connect on SFERA using the name they go by in
            everyday life. Our authenticity policies are intended to create a safe environment where people can trust
            and hold one another accountable.</p>
        <p>In order to maintain a safe environment and empower free expression, we remove accounts that are harmful to
            the community, including those that compromise the security of other accounts and our services. We have
            built a combination of automated and manual systems to block and remove accounts that are used to
            persistently or egregiously abuse our Community Standards.</p>
        <p>Because account level removal is a severe action, whenever possible, we aim to give our community a chance to
            learn our rules and follow our Community Standards. Penalties, including account disables, are designed to
            be proportionate to the severity of the violation and the risk of harm posed to the community. Continued
            violations, despite repeated warnings and restrictions, or violations that pose severe safety risks will
            lead to an account being disabled.</p>
        <p><b>We do not allow the use of our services and will restrict or disable accounts or other entities (such as
                pages, groups, and events) if you:</b></p>

            <li>Create or use an account that demonstrates an intent to violate our Community Standards.</li>
            <li>Create an account, Page, Group or Event to evade our enforcement actions, including creating an account
                to bypass a restriction or after we have disabled your previous account, Page, Group or Event.</li>
            <li>Impersonate others by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Using their photos with the explicit aim to deceive others.</li>
                    <li>Creating an account assuming to be or speak for another person or entity.</li>
                    <li>Creating a Page assuming to be or speak for another person or entity for whom the user is not
                        authorized to do so.</li>

        </ul>
        <p><b>In certain cases, such as those outlined below, we will seek further information about an account before
                taking actions ranging from temporarily restricting accounts to permanently disabling them.</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accounts misrepresenting their identity by:

            <li>Empty accounts with prolonged dormancy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Spam</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>We work hard to limit the spread of spam because we do not want to allow content that is designed to deceive,
            or that attempts to mislead users, to increase viewership. This content creates a negative user experience,
            detracts from people's ability to engage authentically in online communities and can threaten the security,
            stability and usability of our services. We also aim to prevent people from abusing our platform, products
            or features to artificially increase viewership or distribute content en masse for commercial gain.</p>
        <h4>Do not:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Post, share, engage with content or create accounts, Groups, Pages, Events or other assets, either
                manually or automatically, at very high frequencies.</li>
            <li>Attempt to or successfully sell, buy or exchange site privileges, engagement, or product features, such
                as accounts, admin roles, permission to post, Pages, Groups, likes and “Rating marks”, etc.,</li>
            <li>Require or claim that users are required to engage with content (e.g. liking and Rating, sharing) before
                they are able to view or interact with promised content. </li>
            <li>Encourage likes and rating, shares, follows, clicks or the use of apps or websites under false
                pretenses, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Offering false or non-existent services or functionality.</li>
                    <li>Failing to direct to promised content.</li>
                    <li>The deceptive or misleading use of URLs, defined as:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Cloaking:</b> Presenting different content to SFERA users and SFERA crawlers or
                                tools.</li>
                            <li><b>Misleading content:</b> Content contains a link that promises one type of content but
                                delivers something substantially different.</li>
                            <li><b>Deceptive redirect behavior:</b> Websites that require an action (e.g. captcha, watch
                                ad, click here) in order to view the expected landing page content and the domain name
                                of the URL changes after the required action is complete.</li>
                            <li><b>Like/Rate/share-gating:</b> Landing pages that require users to like or rate share,
                                or otherwise engage with content before gaining access to content.</li>
                            <li>And other behaviors that are substantially similar to the above.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>We recognize that the safety of our users includes the security of their personal information, accounts,
            profiles and other SFERA entities they may manage, as well as our products and services more broadly.
            Attempts to gather sensitive personal information or engage in unauthorized access by deceptive or invasive
            methods are harmful to the authentic, open and safe atmosphere that we want to foster. Therefore, we do not
            allow attempts to gather sensitive user information or engage in unauthorized access through the abuse of
            our platform, products, or services. </p>
        <h4>Do not:</h4>
        <p>Attempt to compromise user accounts, profiles, or other SFERA entities, abuse our products or services,
            gather sensitive information through deceptive means, or attempt to engage in unauthorized access,
            including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gaining access to accounts, profiles SFERA Project, Inc. entities, or user data other than your own
                through deceptive means or without explicit permission from the account, profile, or entity owner.</li>
            <li>Encouraging or deceiving users to download or run files or programs that will compromise a user’s online
                or data security, including through malicious software or websites. Such files and programs will be
                deemed malicious software or "malware" if they harm or gain unauthorized access to a computer, device,
                or network.</li>
            <li>Attempting to obtain, acquire or request another user’s login credentials, personal information or other
                sensitive data - whether explicitly or through deceptive means such as phishing (e.g. fake surveys
                designed to capture log-in info or links to fake login pages or impostor websites) or the use of
                malicious software or websites.</li>
            <li>Publicly sharing your own or others’ login information, either on platform or through a third party
                service.</li>
            <li>Creating, sharing or hosting malicious software including browser extensions and mobile applications, on
                or off the platform that put our users or products and services at risk.</li>
            <li>Providing online infrastructure, including web hosting services, domain name system servers and ad
                networks that enables abusive links such that a majority of those links on SFERA or Instagram violate
                the spam or cybersecurity sections of the Community Standards. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Inauthentic Behavior</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>In line with our commitment to authenticity, we do not allow people to misrepresent themselves on SFERA, use
            fake accounts, artificially boost the popularity of content or engage in behaviors designed to enable other
            violations under our Community Standards. This policy is intended to protect the security of user accounts
            and our services, and create a space where people can trust the people and communities they interact with.
        </p>
        <h4>Do not:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use multiple SFERA accounts or share accounts between multiple people</li>
            <li>Misuse SFERA reporting systems to harass others</li>
            <li>Conceal a Page’s purpose by misleading users about the ownership or control of that Page</li>
            <li>Engage in or claim to engage in inauthentic behavior, which is defined as the use of SFERA assets
                (accounts, Pages, Groups, or Events), to mislead people or SFERA:
                <ul>
                    <li>About the identity, purpose, or origin of the entity that they represent.</li>
                    <li>About the popularity of SFERA content or assets.</li>
                    <li>About the purpose of an audience or community.</li>
                    <li>About the source or origin of content.</li>
                    <li>To evade enforcement under our Community Standards.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the following Community Standards, we require additional information and/or context to enforce: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not allow entities to engage in, or claim to engage in Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, defined
                as the use of multiple SFERA assets, working in concert to engage in Inauthentic Behavior (as defined
                above), where the use of fake accounts is central to the operation</li>
            <li>We do not allow entities to engage in, or claim to engage in foreign or government interference, which
                is Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior conducted on behalf of a foreign or government actor.</li>
            <li>We do not allow governments that have instituted sustained blocks of social media to use their official
                departments, agencies, and embassies to deny the use of force or violent events in the context of an
                attack against the territorial integrity of another state in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN
                charter.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Misinformation</h3>
        <h4>Policy Rationale</h4>
        <p>Misinformation is different from other types of speech addressed in our Community Standards because there is
            no way to articulate a comprehensive list of what is prohibited. With graphic violence or hate speech, for
            instance, our policies specify the speech we prohibit, and even persons who disagree with those policies can
            follow them. With misinformation, however, we cannot provide such a line. The world is changing constantly,
            and what is true one minute may not be true the next minute. People also have different levels of
            information about the world around them, and may believe something is true when it is not. A policy that
            simply prohibits “misinformation” would not provide useful notice to the people who use our services and
            would be unenforceable, as we don’t have perfect access to information.</p>
        <p>Instead, our policies articulate different categories of misinformation and try to provide clear guidance
            about how we treat that speech when we see it. For each category, our approach reflects our attempt to
            balance our values of expression, safety, dignity, authenticity, and privacy.</p>
        <p>We remove misinformation where it is likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent physical harm. We
            also remove content that is likely to directly contribute to interference with the functioning of political
            processes and certain highly deceptive manipulated media. In determining what constitutes misinformation in
            these categories, we partner with independent experts who possess knowledge and expertise to assess the
            truth of the content and whether it is likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent harm. This
            includes, for instance, partnering with human rights organizations with a presence on the ground in a
            country to determine the truth of a rumor about civil conflict, and partnering with health organizations
            during the global COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>For all other misinformation, we focus on reducing its prevalence or creating an environment that fosters a
            productive dialogue. We know that people often use misinformation in harmless ways, such as to exaggerate a
            point (“This team has the worst record in the history of the sport!”) or in humor or satire (“My husband
            just won Husband of the Year.”) They also may share their experience through stories that contain
            inaccuracies. In some cases, people share deeply-held personal opinions that others consider false or share
            information that they believe to be true but others consider incomplete or misleading.</p>
        <p>Recognizing how common such speech is, we focus on slowing the spread of hoaxes and viral misinformation, and
            directing users to authoritative information. </p>
        <p>As online and offline environments change and evolve, we will continue to evolve these policies. SFERA
            accounts that repeatedly share the misinformation listed below may, in addition to having their content
            removed, receive decreased distribution, limitations on their ability to advertise, or be removed from our
            platforms.</p>
        <h3>Misinformation we remove:</h3>
        <p>We remove the following types of misinformation:</p>
        <h4>I. Physical Harm or Violence</h4>
        <p>We remove misinformation or unverifiable rumors that expert partners have determined are likely to directly
            contribute to a risk of imminent violence or physical harm to people. We define misinformation as content
            with a claim that is determined to be false by an authoritative third party. We define an unverifiable rumor
            as a claim whose source expert partners confirm is extremely hard or impossible to trace, for which
            authoritative sources are absent, where there is not enough specificity for the claim to be debunked, or
            where the claim is too incredulous or too irrational to be believed.</p>
        <p>We know that sometimes misinformation that might appear benign could, in a specific context, contribute to a
            risk of offline harm, including threats of violence that could contribute to a heightened risk of death,
            serious injury, or other physical harm. </p>
        <h4>II. Harmful Health Misinformation</h4>
        <p>The harmful health misinformation that we remove includes the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Misinformation about vaccines.</b> We remove misinformation primarily about vaccines when public
                health authorities conclude that the information is false and likely to directly contribute to imminent
                vaccine refusals. They include:
                <ol>
                    <li>Vaccines cause autism (Ex: “Increased vaccinations are why so many kids have autism these
                        days.”)</li>
                    <li>Vaccines cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Ex: “Don’t you know vaccines cause SIDS?”</li>
                    <li>Vaccines cause the disease against which they are meant to protect, or cause the person
                        receiving the vaccine to be more likely to get the disease (Ex: “Taking a vaccine actually makes
                        you more likely to get the disease since there’s a strain of the disease inside. Beware!”)</li>
                    <li>Vaccines or their ingredients are deadly, toxic, poisonous, harmful, or dangerous (Ex: “Sure,
                        you can take vaccines, if you don’t mind putting poison in your body.”)</li>
                    <li>Natural immunity is safer than vaccine-acquired immunity (Ex: “It’s safest to just get the
                        disease rather than the vaccine.”)</li>
                    <li>It is dangerous to get several vaccines in a short period of time, even if that timing is
                        medically recommended (Ex: “Never take more than one vaccine at the same time, that is dangerous
                        - I don’t care what your doctor tells you!”)</li>
                    <li>Vaccines are not effective at preventing the disease against which they purport to protect.
                        However, for the COVID-19, flu, and malaria vaccines, we do not remove claims that those
                        vaccines are not effective in preventing someone from contracting those viruses. (Ex’s: Remove –
                        “The polio vaccine doesn’t do anything to stop you from getting the disease”; Remove – “Vaccines
                        actually don’t do anything to stop you from getting diseases”; Allow – “The vaccine doesn’t stop
                        you from getting COVID-19, that’s why you still need to socially distance and wear a mask when
                        you’re around others.”)</li>
                    <li>Acquiring measles cannot cause death (requires additional information and/or context) (Ex:
                        “Don’t worry about whether you get measles, it can’t be fatal.”)</li>
                    <li>Vitamin C is as effective as vaccines in preventing diseases for which vaccines exist.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Misinformation about health during public health emergencies.</b> We remove misinformation during
                public health emergencies when public health authorities conclude that the information is false and
                likely to directly contribute to the risk of imminent physical harm, including by contributing to the
                risk of individuals getting or spreading a harmful disease or refusing an associated vaccine. We
                identify public health emergencies in partnership with global and local health authorities. This
                currently includes false claims related to COVID-19 that are verified by expert health authorities,
                about the existence or severity of the virus, how to cure or prevent it, how the virus is transmitted or
                who is immune, and false claims which discourage good health practices related to COVID-19 (such as
                getting tested, social distancing, wearing a face mask, and getting a vaccine for COVID-19).</li>
            <li><b>Promoting or advocating for harmful miracle cures for health issues.</b> These include treatments
                where the recommended application, in a health context, is likely to directly contribute to the risk of
                serious injury or death, and the treatment has no legitimate health use (ex: bleach, disinfectant, black
                salve, caustic soda).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>III. Voter or Census Interference</h4>
        <p>In an effort to promote election and census integrity, we remove misinformation that is likely to directly
            contribute to a risk of interference with people’s ability to participate in those processes. This includes
            the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Misinformation about the dates, locations, times, and methods for voting, voter registration, or census
                participation.</li>
            <li>Misinformation about who can vote, qualifications for voting, whether a vote will be counted, and what
                information or materials must be provided in order to vote.</li>
            <li>Misinformation about whether a candidate is running or not.</li>
            <li>Misinformation about who can participate in the census and what information or materials must be
                provided in order to participate.</li>
            <li>Misinformation about government involvement in the census, including, where applicable, that an
                individual's census information will be shared with another (non-census) government agency.</li>
            <li>Content falsely claiming that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is at a voting
                location.</li>
            <li>Explicit false claims that people will be infected by COVID-19 (or another communicable disease) if they
                participate in the voting process.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>IV. Manipulated Media</h4>
        <p>Media can be edited in a variety of ways. In many cases, these changes are benign, such as content being
            cropped or shortened for artistic reasons or music being added. In other cases, the manipulation is not
            apparent and could mislead, particularly in the case of video content. We remove this content because it can
            go viral quickly and experts advise that false beliefs regarding manipulated media often cannot be corrected
            through further discourse. </p>
        <p>We remove videos under this policy if specific criteria are met: (1) the video has been edited or
            synthesized, beyond adjustments for clarity or quality, in ways that are not apparent to an average person,
            and would likely mislead an average person to believe a subject of the video said words that they did not
            say; and (2) the video is the product of artificial intelligence or machine learning, including deep
            learning techniques (e.g., a technical deep-fake), that merges, combines, replaces, and/or superimposes
            content onto a video, creating a video that appears authentic.</p>
