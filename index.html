        <h1>Community Standards</h1>
        <p>Our Community Standards apply to everyone, all around the world, and to all types of content.</p>
        <p>Each section of our Community Standards starts with a “Policy Rationale” that sets out the aims of the policy
            followed by specific policy lines that Content that's not allowed; and
            Content that requires additional information or context to enforce on, content that is allowed with a
            warning screen or content that is allowed but can only be viewed by adults aged 18 and older.
        </p>
        <h2>Violence and Incitement</h2>
        <h3>Policy Rationale</h3>
        <p>We aim to prevent potential offline harm that may be related to content on SFERA. While we understand that
            people commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or calling for violence in non-serious ways,
            we remove language that incites or facilitates serious violence. We remove content, disable accounts and
            work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to
            public safety. We also try to consider the language and context in order to distinguish casual statements
            from content that constitutes a credible threat to public or personal safety. In determining whether a
            threat is credible, we may also consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the
            risks to their physical safety.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence. This includes content where a symbol represents
                the target and/or includes a visual of an armament or method to represent violence.</li>
            <li>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified but a symbol represents
                the target and/or includes a visual of an armament or method that represents violence.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Private individuals (name and/or face match are required) or minor public figures that includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Statements of intent, calls for action, advocating, aspirational or conditional statements to
                        commit low-severity violence</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
